## Installation & Setup

The client and server cannot be run at the same time on a same machine. Kindly use two different machines to run them at the same time.

### Frontend Setup (NextJS)

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oonkarrr/vibe.git
    cd vibe
    cd client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
    npm install
   ```

3. Start the NextJS development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Backend Setup (NodeJS)

1. Navigate to the backend folder:

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Install the required Node modules:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the node server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Integration Between Frontend and Backend

- The NextJS frontend communicates with the NodeJS backend using axios APIs for fetching data and interacting with the machine learning model.
- The backend processes user input, runs predictions using the trained AI model, and returns the results to the frontend.
